## 🛠️ Current Features

### 1. Bilingual Taglish NLP Ingestion & Named Entity Recognition (NER)
*   **Purpose:** Bypasses the need for expensive physical IoT sensors by converting raw, informal text reports from public channels into structured geospatial hazards.
*   **What it does:** Extracts location tokens (street names, landmarks) and classifies flood depth indicators from conversational, bilingual Taglish text feeds (e.g., *"Baha sa may Caruncho Ave, lagpas tuhod"*).
*   **How it works:** 
    1. Normalizes raw text inputs (lowercasing, punctuation stripping).
    2. Runs a custom-trained **spaCy Named Entity Recognition (NER)** sequence-labeling pipeline to identify geographic tokens.
    3. Matches extracted depth entities (e.g., *tuhod*, *dibdib*) against a rule-based dictionary to map Taglish colloquialisms to standardized severity metrics (Low, Moderate, High, Extreme).
    4. Automatically scores the parsing reliability with two metrics: `location_confidence` and `severity_confidence`.
*   **Access & Roles:** Public users can submit reports; DRRM officers review and validate the outputs.
*   **Related Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** [FloodReportPanel.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/hazards/FloodReportPanel.tsx) (for manual text submission and incident reporting).
    *   **Backend:** [reports.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/reports.py) endpoint (`POST /api/v1/reports`), `app.services.spacy` pipelines.

---

### 2. Flood-Adaptive Route Calculation & Rerouting
*   **Purpose:** Ensures commuter safety by dynamically routing vehicles around active flood hazards.
*   **What it does:** Calculates optimal navigation paths between origin and destination coordinates, ensuring that any road segments intersecting active flood zones are bypassed.
*   **How it works:**
    1. When a user requests a route, the backend fetches all active avoidance polygons from the PostGIS database.
    2. The routing service queries the local **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)** engine using a road network graph topology.
    3. If any road segment (edge) intersects an active flood avoidance polygon, its travel cost weight is dynamically modified in the routing cost matrix to infinity ($\infty$).
    4. The routing algorithm treats the segment as an impassable barrier, generating a safe alternative detour route.
    5. The commuter can toggle "Ignore Floods" to compare the safe path against the default flooded route.
*   **Access & Roles:** Open to all public commuters.
*   **Related Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** [RoutePanel.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/routing/RoutePanel.tsx) (input panels, turn-by-turn lists, flood toggle), [MapCanvas.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/map/MapCanvas.tsx).
    *   **Backend:** [reports.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/reports.py) router (`POST /api/v1/reports/route`), [routing.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/services/routing.py) service (`calculate_flood_safe_route`).

---

### 3. Queue-Based Admin Moderation & Approval Workflow
*   **Purpose:** Implements a "human-in-the-loop" validation workflow to prevent automated NLP ingestion errors or mapping hallucinations from misdirecting drivers.
*   **What it does:** Queues all raw NLP-parsed flood reports into a staging feed, allowing authorized local disaster risk managers to inspect, adjust, approve, or discard reports before public broadcast.
*   **How it works:**
    1. Newly parsed reports are inserted with a status of `pending`.
    2. DRRM operators review the reports, verify the geolocations, and click "Approve".
    3. Upon approval, PostGIS automatically calculates a spatial buffer (using `ST_Buffer` with a 50m to 200m radius depending on whether the asset is a Point or LineString) around the coordinate.
    4. This buffer is saved to the `flood_avoidance_zones` table as an active polygon, which immediately updates OSRM edge weights.
    5. Discarded reports are marked as `rejected`.
*   **Access & Roles:** Restricted to `admin` / `drrm` roles.
*   **Related Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** [ReportsPage.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/admin/ReportsPage.tsx) (interactive queue cards, map coordinates auditor).
    *   **Backend:** [admin.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin.py) endpoints (`/reports/pending`, `/reports/{report_id}/approve`, `/reports/{report_id}/reject`).

---

### 4. Interactive Spatial Map Visualization (WebGL Tiles & Autocomplete)
*   **Purpose:** Renders real-time hazard layers, detour vectors, and geocoding on a performant mobile canvas.
*   **What it does:** Displays an interactive street map overlaying color-coded pins (White, Yellow, Orange, Red) for flood heights, outlines avoidance zone shapes, and handles address geocoding search.
*   **How it works:**
    1. Utilizes **MapLibre GL JS** to render vector maps on the client side using WebGL.
    2. Feeds OpenStreetMap tiles for zero-cost, self-hosted base imagery.
    3. Integrates the **Komoot Photon API** (`photon.komoot.io`) for geocoding search, localized and scored specifically for Pasig City bounds to provide relevant location autocomplete results.
    4. Renders geo-coordinates as visual icons and polygon vectors in real time.
*   **Access & Roles:** Public commuters and system administrators.
*   **Related Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** [MapCanvas.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/map/MapCanvas.tsx), [MapContext.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/map/MapContext.tsx), [geocodingApi.ts](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/geocoding/geocodingApi.ts).

---

### 5. Real-Time Event Signaling (WebSockets Integration)
*   **Purpose:** Ensures instant, reactive visual updates across commuter and admin maps without forcing manual browser refreshes.
*   **What it does:** Signals active database events (approvals, deactivations, database cleans) from the backend directly to active frontend sessions.
*   **How it works:**
    1. The React app opens a native `WebSocket` connection to the FastAPI server at `/api/v1/ws`.
    2. The backend maintains an active connection manager mapping open client sockets.
    3. When an admin approves a report or deactivates a zone, the server broadcasts an event (e.g. `report_approved`).
    4. The frontend intercepts the payload and automatically invalidates the React Query cache, triggering a silent background refetch of map layers.
*   **Access & Roles:** Public clients and administrative dashboards.
*   **Related Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** [useWebSocket.ts](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts), `providers.tsx`.
    *   **Backend:** [websocket.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/websocket.py), `app.core.websocket`.

---

### 6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & JWT Security
*   **Purpose:** Secures sensitive admin interfaces, settings, and database endpoints from public modifications.
*   **What it does:** Separates authorization levels between `commuters` and `admin` / `drrm` profiles, enforcing login parameters and auditing.
*   **How it works:**
    1. Hashes passwords using **bcrypt** with adaptive salt rounds before database storage.
    2. Issues signed **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** via `python-jose` containing the user ID and role during login.
    3. FastAPI route handlers intercept calls using dependency injection (`get_current_active_admin`) to validate JWT signatures and enforce permissions.
*   **Access & Roles:** Registration is open to all; admin pages require role-checks.
*   **Related Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** [LoginForm.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/auth/LoginForm.tsx), [SignupForm.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/auth/SignupForm.tsx).
    *   **Backend:** [auth.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py), [users.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/users.py), [deps.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/api/deps.py).

### 7. Offline Resiliency & PWA Capabilities
*   **Purpose:** Ensures mobility tool usability when mobile cellular networks degrade during severe weather.
*   **What it does:** Caches static assets, intercepts network failures, and alerts commuters when they go offline.
*   **How it works:**
    1. Operates as a Progressive Web App using `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` service workers.
    2. Caches maps, styles, and dashboard templates locally in browser storage.
    3. Uses `idb-keyval` (IndexedDB utility) to store basic state configuration variables.
    4. Triggers an offline banner warning when the browser's `navigator.onLine` state toggles off.
*   **Access & Roles:** Public commuters.
*   **Related Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** [OfflineBanner.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/offline/OfflineBanner.tsx), `frontend/package.json`.

---

### 8. System Audit Logging & Trail
*   **Purpose:** Maintains organizational transparency and logs all administrative updates to prevent accidental or malicious map changes.
*   **What it does:** Logs admin actions (report approval, rejection, user deletion, backups, data clears, configurations) to a central ledger.
*   **How it works:**
    1. Every admin-restricted route wraps its database transaction with an `audit_log` write operation.
    2. Saves details including `admin_id`, `action_type`, `target_table`, `metadata_json` (containing changes details), `ip_address`, and a UTC timestamp.
*   **Access & Roles:** Admins can view this ledger.
*   **Related Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** [AuditTrailPage.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/admin/AuditTrailPage.tsx).
    *   **Backend:** [admin.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin.py) (`/audit-logs`), [audit.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/models/audit.py) schema & models.

---

### 9. Database Backup, Exports & Cleanup Management
*   **Purpose:** Protects database integrity, enables archival, and exports research data.
*   **What it does:** Creates and restores SQL dumps of the PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, exports reports/avoidance zones as CSV or JSON, and implements records cleaning.
*   **How it works:**
    1. Exports query database tables using standard Python `csv` and `json` libraries.
    2. Backup calls trigger shell processes (`docker exec` executing `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`) to compress or import dump files.
    3. Cleanup sweeps database tables, purging old flood incident logs and zones older than user-specified date ranges.
*   **Access & Roles:** Limited to admins.
*   **Related Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** [DataManagementPage.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/admin/DataManagementPage.tsx).
    *   **Backend:** [data.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/data.py), [data_service.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/services/data_service.py).

---

### 10. Cloudinary Photo Evidence Upload
*   **Purpose:** Allows commuters to submit visual proof of flood hazards to assist admin validation and provide objective severity data.
*   **What it does:** Uploads a user-provided image alongside the text report, securely hosts it, and displays it in the moderation dashboard.
*   **How it works:**
    1. The frontend collects the image file and submits it via `multipart/form-data`.
    2. The FastAPI backend streams the file to **Cloudinary** via their Python SDK.
    3. Cloudinary resizes the image (max width 1024px) and converts it to WebP format for high compression and rapid delivery.
    4. The resulting CDN URL is saved as `image_url` in the PostgreSQL database.
*   **Access & Roles:** Public users can upload; administrators can view.
*   **Related Components:**
    *   **Frontend:** [FloodReportPanel.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/hazards/FloodReportPanel.tsx) (upload UI), [ReportsPage.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/admin/ReportsPage.tsx) (thumbnail view).
    *   **Backend:** [cloudinary_service.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/services/cloudinary_service.py), [reports.py](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/reports.py).

## 🔮 Future Features

### 1. Height-Aware Rerouting (Dynamic Vehicle Profiles)
*   **Purpose:** Customizes detour calculations based on vehicle clearance constraints.
*   **Why it is needed:** Currently, any high severity flood blocks routes for all commuters. However, a high-clearance SUV or truck can safely cross knee-deep water (Yellow/Orange) that would stall a standard sedan or motorcycle. 
*   **Expected functionality:**
    *   Commuters select their vehicle profile (e.g., Motorcycle, Sedan, SUV, Truck).
    *   The backend retrieves specific clearance thresholds (e.g., 20cm for Sedan, 45cm for SUV).
    *   When checking flood polygons, OSRM will only apply the infinity ($\infty$) edge cost if the flood depth exceeds the vehicle's clearing height.
*   **How it will integrate:**
    *   Update [RoutePanel.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/routing/RoutePanel.tsx) with a vehicle selector dropdown.
    *   Update OSRM backend configurations to load multiple routing profiles or pass dynamic weight multipliers in OSRM matrix calculations.
*   **Dependencies:** Database must store exact numeric flood depths (in cm) instead of only textual categories.

---

### 2. User-Submitted Image Depth Classifier (Computer Vision AI)
*   **Purpose:** Automates flood severity validation via crowdsourced visual proof.
*   **Why it is needed:** Text descriptions are often subjective or exaggerated. While we currently accept photo evidence (via Cloudinary), human admins must still verify them. An AI classifier will automate the objective verification of street conditions.
*   **Expected functionality:**
    *   Commuters upload a photo of the road flood (already implemented).
    *   A deep learning model (e.g., CNN or YOLO) analyzes the uploaded image URL from Cloudinary.
    *   It detects key anchor references (submerged wheels, fire hydrants, doors) to classify water height.
    *   Populates the moderation queue with the visual estimation of severity.
*   **How it will integrate:**
    *   Establish a secondary Python ML worker (or use FastAPI background tasks) running a PyTorch pipeline to process image URLs.
*   **Dependencies:** Host machine GPU acceleration, a trained reference dataset of street-level urban flooding photos.

---

### 3. Automated Social Media Scraper Service (X/Twitter and Facebook APIs)
*   **Purpose:** Dramatically speeds up data ingestion by eliminating reliance on manual reports.
*   **Why it is needed:** During typhoons, emergency data updates are shared at high velocity across social media platforms like X (Twitter) and Facebook. An automated crawler will capture these inputs in real time.
*   **Expected functionality:**
    *   A celery-based background worker continuously queries X and Facebook search endpoints for keyword patterns (e.g., "baha Pasig", "Caruncho Ave baha").
    *   Parsed matches are run through the spaCy NER pipeline and loaded directly into the admin moderation queue.
*   **How it will integrate:**
    *   Add a new scraper microservice to the project stack.
    *   Pipes scraped JSON outputs into the backend `/api/v1/reports` API.
*   **Dependencies:** Developer API keys from Twitter/X and Meta Platforms.

---

### 4. Bilingual Speech-to-Text Voice Reporting
*   **Purpose:** Enables motorists in transit to report active hazards hands-free.
*   **Why it is needed:** Typist reporting is dangerous for active drivers. Letting users dictate short reports keeps eyes on the road during severe storms.
*   **Expected functionality:**
    *   Commuters tap a microphone button, record a Taglish description (e.g., *"Baha rito sa San Joaquin, lagpas bewang na"*), and submit.
    *   The system transcribes the speech and pipes the raw text into spaCy.
*   **How it will integrate:**
    *   Integrate browser MediaRecorder APIs in [FloodReportPanel.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/hazards/FloodReportPanel.tsx).
    *   Create a backend utility using a bilingual transcription framework (e.g., OpenAI Whisper).
*   **Dependencies:** Speech-to-Text model pipeline, micro-permissions access in browser clients.

---

### 5. Turn-by-Turn Voice Navigation (Text-to-Speech)
*   **Purpose:** Prevents driver distractions by dictating detour directions audibly.
*   **Why it is needed:** Drivers cannot safely read map paths or turn-by-turn lists while navigating heavy rain and storm conditions.
*   **Expected functionality:**
    *   The PWA speaks directions aloud (e.g., *"In 200 meters, turn left to bypass the flooded street ahead"*).
*   **How it will integrate:**
    *   Hook into the HTML5 **Web Speech API (`SpeechSynthesis`)** inside [RoutePanel.tsx](file:///e:/Files/Documents/GitHub/LANES/frontend/src/features/routing/RoutePanel.tsx).
    *   Trigger directions audio prompts based on geolocation tracking updates relative to the OSRM path coordinate array.
*   **Dependencies:** Secure HTTPS deployment (for geolocation sensor permissions).

---

### 6. IoT Telemetric Sensor Nodes Integration
*   **Purpose:** Automatically registers baseline hazard metrics at high-risk municipal points.
*   **Why it is needed:** Certain low-lying streets (e.g., Pasig Mega Market perimeter) flood during every minor rainfall event. Real-time telemetry ensures instant database updates.
*   **Expected functionality:**
    *   Ultrasonic water-level sensors measure current road water levels.
    *   The sensor microcontrollers transmit depth values directly to the spatial database.
    *   Avoidance zones are automatically updated without manual administrator intervention.
*   **How it will integrate:**
    *   Build a dedicated backend route handler `POST /api/v1/telemetry/report` restricted to authenticated IoT gateway tokens.
    *   Pipes telemetric depth metrics directly into the PostGIS database.
*   **Dependencies:** Physical ESP32 microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensors, and cellular/LoRa transmitters.
